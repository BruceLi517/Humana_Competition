# Humana_Competition
I led a team of three to compete against almost 300 teams by building models and identifying the underlying barriers among members in LPPO (Local Preferred Provider Organization) plans who are not engaging in preventive care with a PCP (Primary Care Physician). We placed 36th out of 284 teams in round 1, advancing to round 2 as part of the top 50.

Primary Care Physician (PCP) visits are critical for maintaining health, managing chronic conditions, and preventing disease. No engagement with PCP, several negative outcomes can occur, impacting both health and business objectives like deterioration of health outcomes and higher healthcare costs. The objective of our study is to leverage insights derived from data analysis and modeling, supplemented by medical and business research, to identify the factors influencing the likelihood of members visiting their PCPs for preventive care. By understanding these factors, we aim to develop targeted strategies that enhance PCP engagement rates among Humana members.
